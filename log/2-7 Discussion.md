##2018/2/7 Project 2 Discusion 

####Topic: New York Trip Planner

####Target Audience: 
- New visitors in New York
- People who have free time and need to find something to do in New York


####Final visualization sample:
- Home page : GIF (Introduce our app, welcome page)
- Left Panel: 
    - Location: My Location (maybe need to type the location or click on the map?)  
    - Types:  Restaurant, Museum/Gallery, Theater, Park, Shopping, Subway Station, Library, Wifi(database needed)
    - Time/Cost: May appear on the left panel or after chose the route?

####Visualization Sample:
![demo](/Users/crystal/Desktop/5243-ADS/Spring2018-Project2-group-4/log/demo.jpg)

- According to the choices, pick 3 or 5 different routes and show the score of each route. (May also add time spend and money cost.)
- Different routes can show with different colors and different types of locations can also be label with different colors.
- Routes are based on the shortest distance.
- Scores are based on the distance/time/cost...
- Time spend can set as default. (ex. restaurant - 2h, museum - 2.5h, park - 1h)
- Cost is hard to estimate, maybe can ignore.

####Other Issues/Ideas:
- Adding website link (like museum, yelp or google link for restaurant)
- Detailed information can be found on another page.
- Maybe can add some statistics or recommend  places on the other page, like a rank of the popularity of New York restaurants/sightseeings.
- Or focus on Time Square area (for new visitors)(2 dataset in the data folder are correlated to Time Square area)

####Mainly Work Before Next Class:
* Write out the score algorithm 
* Find database: 
     - Restaurant
     - Museum/Gallery
     - Theater
     - Park
     - Shopping
     - Subway Station
     - Library
     - Wifi
     - Location point for New York (for locating my location)
